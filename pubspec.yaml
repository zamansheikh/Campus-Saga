# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
uses-material-design: true

# To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
# assets:
#   - assets/images/
#   - assets/temp/
#   - assets/svg/
#   - assets/icon/
#   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

# An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

# For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

# To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
# in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# example:
fonts:
  - family: Urbanist
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Black.ttf
        weight: 900
      - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Bold.ttf
        weight: 700
      - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-ExtraBold.ttf
        weight: 800
      - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-ExtraLight.ttf
        weight: 200
      - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Light.ttf
        weight: 300
      - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Medium.ttf
        weight: 500
      - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Regular.ttf
        weight: 400
      - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-SemiBold.ttf
        weight: 600
  - family: Boogaloo
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Boogaloo-Regular.ttf
        weight: 400      
#   - family: Trajan Pro
#     fonts:
#       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#         weight: 700
#
