Architecture for your social media app using Flutter and the GetX library while following the MVC pattern:


Project Structure:
```

```

Dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  get: ^4.5.1
  http: ^0.14.0
  image_picker: ^0.8.4+3
  # Add other dependencies as needed
```

Model Classes (in the `models` folder):
- `UserModel`
- `PostModel`
- `UniversityModel`

Controller Classes (in the `controllers` folder):
- `AuthController`
- `HomeController`
- `PromotionController`
- `AddPostController`
- `RankingController`
- `ProfileController`

View Classes (in the respective `modules` folder):
- `HomePage`
- `PromotionPage`
- `AddPostPage`
- `RankingPage`
- `ProfilePage`

Service Classes (in the `services` folder):
- `AuthenticationService`
- `PostService`
- `UniversityService`

Binding Classes (in the `bindings` folder):
- `HomeBinding`
- `PromotionBinding`
- `AddPostBinding`
- `RankingBinding`
- `ProfileBinding`

`routes.dart`:
```dart
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'app/modules/home/home_binding.dart';
import 'app/modules/home/home_page.dart';

final List<GetPage> routes = [
  GetPage(name: '/', page: () => HomePage(), binding: HomeBinding()),
  // Add other routes as needed
];
```

Remember that this is a basic outline, and you can further expand and customize it based on your app's specific requirements. You'll need to implement the methods and logic within the controllers, services, and models according to your app's functionality. Make sure to follow good coding practices, handle exceptions, and validate user inputs.

Additionally, you can organize your assets in the `assets` folder and update the `pubspec.yaml` file to include them:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/
```

This suggested structure follows the MVC pattern and separates your app's components for better organization and maintainability. GetX is a powerful state management library that can help you manage the app's state, routes, and dependency injection efficiently.
