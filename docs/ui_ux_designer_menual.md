# UI/UX Design Documentation for Campus Saga

## Introduction

This document serves as a guide for UI/UX designers to create the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design for a social media app. The app allows university students to post problems, receive feedback from university admins, and interact with other users. The app features a login and registration process, post creation, university ranking, and user profile management.

## App Structure

The app follows a modular architecture and MVC pattern for efficient code organization. It includes the following modules:

1. **Authentication**: User registration and login.
2. **Home**: Displays user posts and admin feedback.
3. **Promotion**: Promotional content showcase.
4. **Add Post**: Create new posts.
5. **Ranking**: University ranking based on user activity.
6. **Profile**: User profile information and settings.

## Design Guidelines

### Color Scheme

Use a clean and user-friendly color palette. Consider using university colors for branding, and include dark mode support for enhanced user experience.

### Typography

Choose a legible and modern font for better readability.

### Icons

Select appropriate icons for navigation, actions, and feedback elements.

### UI Elements

1. **Login & Registration**: Design intuitive login and registration screens with fields for name, phone number, password, gender, university, and department.

2. **Home Page**: Display a list of posts with user avatars, post headings, descriptions, images/videos, and solved status. Include upvote/downvote buttons and admin feedback sections for solved posts.

3. **Promotion Page**: Showcase promotional content in a visually appealing manner.

4. **Add Post Page**: Create a user-friendly form for creating posts. Include options for post type (problem/promotion), title, description, and attachments.

5. **Ranking Page**: Present university ranking based on user interactions, solved posts, upvotes, and response time.

6. **Profile Page**: Show user information, university, department, and verified status. Include an edit profile option and a burger menu for additional actions.

### UX Guidelines

1. **Navigation**: Design an intuitive bottom navigation bar with icons for easy navigation between modules.

2. **Post Interaction**: Ensure a smooth user experience when interacting with posts, such as upvoting, downvoting, and viewing admin feedback.

3. **Profile Settings**: Create a seamless process for users to edit their profiles, access app information, terms, and conditions, and log out.

4. **University Ranking**: Visualize the ranking data in an engaging manner, allowing users to search for specific universities and view detailed statistics.

## Deliverables

1. **Wireframes**: Provide wireframes for each screen/module to illustrate the layout and content arrangement.

2. **UI Design**: Create a high-fidelity UI design for each screen/module, adhering to the design guidelines mentioned above.

3. **Assets**: Deliver icon assets, logo, typography, color codes, and other graphical elements used in the design.

4. **Mockups**: Present interactive mockups showcasing the user journey and interactions.

## Collaboration

Collaborate closely with the development team, including backend and frontend developers, to ensure the feasibility and implementation of the UI/UX design.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, the UI/UX designer can create a visually appealing and user-friendly design for the social media app. The design should focus on enhancing the user experience, encouraging engagement, and reflecting the app's branding and functionality.
